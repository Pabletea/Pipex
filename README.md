## ðŸ“– Description
Pipex is a project that replicates the behavior of the Unix pipe command. It allows executing two commands with inter-process communication via pipes.

This project comprises components for managing and executing pipelines, including utility functions and build configurations. The core `pipex` module handles pipeline operations, while supporting files provide additional functionality.
